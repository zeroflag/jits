Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) (/dʒuːˈdʒɪtsuː/; Portuguese: [ˈʒiw ˈʒit(i)su], [ˈʒu ˈʒit(i)su], [dʒiˈu dʒit(i)ˈsu]; Portuguese: jiu-jitsu brasileiro) is a self-defense martial art & combat sport based on grappling, ground fighting & submission holds, focusing on the skill of controlling one’s opponent through a number of techniques that force him or her to submit via chokeholds & joint locks (newaza).

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu was first developed & modified in Rio de Janeiro in the 1920s by brazilian brothers Carlos, George & Hélio Gracie after Carlos Gracie was taught traditional Kodokan Judo, also referred to as ‘Kano Jiu-Jitsu’ by a travelling Japanese judoka Mitsuyo Maeda in 1917, later going on to develop their own self defence system Gracie Jiu-Jitsu.

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu eventually came to be its own defined combat sport through the innovations, practices & adaptation of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu & judo with governing body’s such as the IBJJF working worldwide.

BJJ teaches that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themself against a bigger, stronger, heavier opponent by using leverage and weight distribution to take the fight to the ground and then applying a number of joint locks or chokeholds to defeat the opponent. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments and in self-defense situations.[5] Sparring (commonly referred to as "rolling" within the BJJ community) and live drilling play a major role in training and the practitioner's development. BJJ is considered a martial art, a sport, a method for promoting physical fitness and building character, and a way of life.[6][7]

Kodokan judo ground fighting (newaza) fundamentals were taught by a number of Japanese individuals including Takeo Yano, Mitsuyo Maeda, Soshihiro Satake, and Isao Okano.
