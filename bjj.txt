Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) (/dʒuːˈdʒɪtsuː/; Portuguese: [ˈʒiw ˈʒit(i)su], [ˈʒu ˈʒit(i)su], [dʒiˈu dʒit(i)ˈsu]; Portuguese: jiu-jitsu brasileiro) is a self-defense martial art & combat sport based on grappling, ground fighting & submission holds, focusing on the skill of controlling one’s opponent through a number of techniques that force him or her to submit via chokeholds & joint locks (newaza).

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu was first developed & modified in Rio de Janeiro in the 1920s by brazilian brothers Carlos, George & Hélio Gracie after Carlos Gracie was taught traditional Kodokan Judo, also referred to as ‘Kano Jiu-Jitsu’ by a travelling Japanese judoka Mitsuyo Maeda in 1917, later going on to develop their own self defence system Gracie Jiu-Jitsu.

Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu eventually came to be its own defined combat sport through the innovations, practices & adaptation of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu & judo with governing body’s such as the IBJJF working worldwide.

BJJ teaches that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themself against a bigger, stronger, heavier opponent by using leverage and weight distribution to take the fight to the ground and then applying a number of joint locks or chokeholds to defeat the opponent. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments and in self-defense situations.[5] Sparring (commonly referred to as "rolling" within the BJJ community) and live drilling play a major role in training and the practitioner's development. BJJ is considered a martial art, a sport, a method for promoting physical fitness and building character, and a way of life.[6][7]

Kodokan judo ground fighting (newaza) fundamentals were taught by a number of Japanese individuals including Takeo Yano, Mitsuyo Maeda, Soshihiro Satake, and Isao Okano.

History
Origins
Geo Omori opened the first Jiu-Jitsu/Judo school in Brazil in 1925.[8] He taught a number of individuals including Luiz França’ Later, Mitsuyo Maeda was one of five of the Kodokan's top groundwork (newaza) experts that judo's founder Kano Jigoro sent overseas to demonstrate and spread his art to the world. Maeda had trained first in sumo as a teenager, and after the interest generated by stories about the success of Kodokan Judo at competitions with other jujutsu schools of the time, became a student of Jigoro Kano.[9] Maeda left Japan in 1904 and visited a number of countries[9] giving "jiu-do" demonstrations and accepting challenges from wrestlers, boxers, savate fighters and various other martial artists before eventually arriving in Brazil on November 14, 1914.[10]

Gracie & Maeda

Gastão Gracie was a business partner of the American Circus in Belém. In 1916, Italian Argentine circus Queirolo Brothers staged shows there and presented Maeda.[11][12] In 1917 Carlos Gracie, the eldest son of Gastão Gracie, watched a demonstration by Maeda at the Da Paz Theatre and decided to learn judo. Maeda accepted Carlos as a student and Carlos was taught for a few years (believed 5-6 year), eventually passing his knowledge on to his brothers. Gracie's account of the events is that his sibling Hélio Gracie gradually further developed Gracie Jiu-Jitsu as a softer, pragmatic adaptation from Judo that focused more on the ground fighting aspect than the throws, since he was unable to perform many judo moves that require direct opposition to an opponent's strength.[13][14]

Although the Gracie family is typically recognized as the main family to first promote Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as it is known today, there was also another prominent lineage derived from Maeda via another Brazilian disciple, Luiz França.[15] This lineage had been represented particularly by Oswaldo Fadda. Fadda and his students were famous for the influential use of footlocks[16] and the lineage still survives through Fadda's links in teams such as Nova União and Grappling Fight Team.[17]
